# ML--BASED-STROKE-RISK-PREDICTION

Objective:
The project involves analyzing the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis will leverage libraries such as numpy and pandas for data manipulation, and sklearn.model_selection for splitting the dataset into training and test sets. Logistic Regression will be used to build a predictive model to determine the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.
